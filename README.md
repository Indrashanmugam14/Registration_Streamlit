It allows candidates to register for job opportunities by submitting their personal details, selecting job preferences, and uploading their resume (PDF format).  
The app supports multiple consecutive registrations and prevents duplicate registrations based on email or phone number.

  - Resume Upload (PDF)

2. Validates input fields to ensure all data is provided.
